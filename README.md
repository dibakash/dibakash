- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dibakash
- I was always tech savvy but my urge to learn with an in-depth understanding of how things work in various CS technologies.
- Began my profound technology journey in early 2020. The first programming language I ever learned was Javascript which I started learning in mid of 2019
- Prior to this I was running a small website designing firm (mostly WordPress based) in northeast India. 
- The constant need to build high-quality applications forced me to jump into full-stack development.
- Equipping myself with present and future technologies has proven to be empowering, which I didn't feel even after an MBA in Marketing and Entrepreneurship in 2014.
- I was mostly a self-taught programmer (thanks to Prof. David J. Malan and programs like Harvard's CS50, and various other resources).
- My self-taught programming got a real shape after qualifying for the "IIT Madras BS Degree in Programming and Data Science"
- IIT Madras solidified my confidence and knowledge in the field of tech, web dev, and especially Application development and Data science. 
- I am looking forward to creating real value with the skills that I have gained and will gain in this wonderful journey.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Dev-ops, App dev, mobile apps, entrepreneurhips, Open to Dev / Data Science Jobs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... PDSA, DBMS, Linear Algebra, Statistics for Data Science
